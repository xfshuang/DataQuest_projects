In this project, I work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth, to explore and analyze data from this [database](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/257/factbook.db).

The Factbook contains demographic information like:
* population - The population as of 2015.
* population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
* area - The total land and water area.
